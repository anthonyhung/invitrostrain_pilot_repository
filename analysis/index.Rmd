# Analysis of scRNA and bulk RNA sequencing data for "Characterizing gene expression responses to biomechanical strain in an in vitro model of osteoarthritis" project.

LCL-derived iPSCs from 3 Yoruba individuals were differentiated into mesenchymal stem cells and subsequently into chondrocytes. iPSC-derived chondrocytes were either placed under control conditions or treated with cyclic tensile strain for 24 hours (Total of 6 individual x treatment pairs). 3 technical replicates of the MSC-chondrocyte differentiation + strain/control treatment were conducted.Single cell RNAseq using the 10x platform was conducted for one replicate of the experiment (collection of one sample failed, meaning only 5 samples were single-cell sequenced). Bulk RNA sequencing was conducted for all 3 technical replicates.

If you are running the files in this repository to recreate the analyses, running them in the order they appear on this list is recommended.
